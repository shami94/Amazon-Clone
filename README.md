This project is a simple clone of the Amazon homepage built using HTML and CSS. It showcases my skills in creating  clean web designs.
The layout mimics the essential features of Amazonâ€™s interface, including a navigation bar, product listings, and footer sections, providing a basic, 
visually appealing structure. The primary focus was on perfecting the HTML structure and styling with CSS to replicate the look and feel of a modern e-commerce website.
